1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: a parameter is a placeholder in an function that doesn't posses any actual value, whereas an argument is the actual data that will get passed into the code. 

Researched answer: a parameter is listed when declare a function; it acts as a placeholder for arguments which are actual values that will be passed to the code. Arguments are the data or expressions that pass into the code. In contrast, parameters don't possess any actual value in itself. 

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer:An object holds data that can be recognized by Javascrpit in forms like keys:values. A class is a blueprint to generate objects. 

Researched answer: Objects is a data type in JavaScript that holds collection of values. It is often written as const object = {
    key1: value1, key2:value2
} The key is primitive data type called symbol and value is any data that can be recognized in JavaScript, so even a function can be considered a value when it is behind a symbol in an object. Classes are the blueprint for objects and they contain both data and behaviors. Classes are also reusable and can create many differnt objects.
